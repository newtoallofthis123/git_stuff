# Quickly Open Git Stuff

Qit is a simple git wrapper that opens the git remote url...that's it.

## Installation

```bash
make build
```

You will then find the qit executable that you can add to your path.

> Note: This program only works on unix based operating systems, however, you are free to make one for windows if you like :)
